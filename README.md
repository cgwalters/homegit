Colin's dotfiles and misc. scripts
----------------------------------

I keep basic config files like `~/.emacs` and `~/.bashrc` in git.
There might be something useful in there for you.  I also have a
collection of miscellaneous scripts in `bin/`, mostly git wrappers.

If you like this repository, you might also find my personal
Ansible https://github.com/cgwalters/ansible-personal repository
useful.
